As someone with a keen interest in finance, I have chosen historical stock prices as the foundation for enhancing my analytical skills. 
The primary objective of this dashboard is to present the historical price variance of top-tier companies over the past five years.
Additionally, gaining insights into the volume and price changes within a specific period allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the correlation and potential reasons influencing these fluctuations.
